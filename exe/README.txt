Game Library Software

This software is a personal game database management tool. It allows users to add, delete, search, and display information about their favorite games.

Features:
- Add a new game to the library with details such as name, category, and platform.
- Delete specific games or the entire game library.
- Search for games based on their name, category, or platform.
- Display all games in the library.

Usage:
1. Run the software and choose from the menu options.
2. Follow the prompts to perform actions like adding or searching for games.
3. View and manage your game library easily.

Note:
- Game data is stored in an SQLite database file named 'game_db.db'.
- If you choose to delete db in exe, when you run the code again, the script creates a new 'game_db.db' file automatically.
- The software creates a folder named 'Game_Library_Software' to store the database file.
- Ensure that the executable and 'manipulate_db.py' are in the same directory for proper functionality.
